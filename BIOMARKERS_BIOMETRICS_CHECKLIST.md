## Notes for Clinicians

### Biomarker Interpretation
- **Optimal ranges** are narrower than standard reference ranges and are associated with better health outcomes and longevity
- **Gender-specific ranges** apply where indicated
- **Age-specific ranges** may apply for certain markers (e.g., hormones, eGFR)
- **Directionality matters:** Some markers are "lower is better" (e.g., ALT, ApoB), others have optimal mid-ranges (e.g., Albumin)

### Biometric Tracking
- Biometrics are self-tracked or device-measured health metrics
- **Pillars** refer to WellPath's health optimization framework:
  - Healthful Nutrition
  - Movement + Exercise
  - Restorative Sleep
  - Stress Management
  - Cognitive Health
  - Core Care

### Clinical Application
1. Compare patient values against **optimal ranges**, not just standard reference ranges
2. Consider trends over time, not just single measurements
3. Integrate biomarker data with biometric tracking for comprehensive health assessment
4. Use pillars framework to organize lifestyle interventions
